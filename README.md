# Split-ledger vault lab

[![ci](https://github.com/dersefurkan/split-ledger-vault-demo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dersefurkan/split-ledger-vault-demo/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Local Foundry lab for money-moving identity bugs, in two shapes:

1. **Split ledgers** — two ledgers credit the same deposit, and each withdrawal path burns only one.
2. **Missing cursor** — a withdrawal queue tracks what a request is worth, but not what it already paid.

This is a delivery sample, not a live exploit. The vulnerable vaults are teaching contracts. The patched vaults are proven with the same tests and with stateful invariants.

## Bug class

`ReceiptSplitVault` records a deposit twice:

| Ledger | Storage | Withdrawal path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | `shares[user]` | `withdrawShares` burns only A |
| B | `receipts[id] = {owner, amount, spent}` | `redeemReceipt` burns only B |

One deposit, two independent claims on the same asset pile. This is the same shape as production losses in receipt-id withdrawals, queue cursors, fast/slow paths, and trusted-forwarder flows where the protocol forgets which identity actually moves the money.

## Reproduce (local only)

Requires [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh). No RPC, no keys, no live transactions.

```bash
forge test            # full suite
forge test -vv        # with traces
```

Directed PoC — 100 deposited, 200 extracted:

```bash
forge test --match-contract SplitLedgerPoC -vv
```

```
[PASS] test_double_pay_via_split_ledgers()
    attacker deposited 100, extracted 200
    victim share record still says 100 — backing is 0
```

## The fix, proven the same way

`ReceiptBoundVault` binds both ledgers to one identity: redeem burns the receipt **and** the share credit. `withdrawShares` is removed.

```bash
forge test --match-contract BoundLedgerInvariant -vv
```

Stateful fuzzing (`runs = 64`, `depth = 12`) drives random deposit/redeem sequences. After every call:

1. `withdrawn ≤ deposited` — no value created
2. `vault balance == deposited − withdrawn` — ledger and backing never diverge

Both hold on the bound vault. The directed PoC shows the split vault violating the same conservation rule.

## Shape 2 — the missing claimed cursor

`EpochQueueVaultVulnerable` is a maturity-gated withdrawal queue: `request` locks funds, `advanceEpoch` matures them, `claim(id, amount)` pays. The bug is what is *not* there — no per-request `claimed` cursor:

```
claim(id, amount):  require(amount <= r.amount)   // pays up to the FULL amount, every call
```

One matured request is claimable at full value until the vault is empty; the last claimants meet a zero balance.

```bash
forge test --match-contract EpochQueuePoC -vv
```

```
[PASS] test_full_reclaim_drains_vulnerable_queue()
  alice requested: 100.000000000000000000
  alice claimed  : 200.000000000000000000
  vault balance  : 0.000000000000000000   (bob's matured claim now reverts)
```

`EpochQueueVaultBound` writes the cursor: `claimed += amount`, claims capped at the remainder. Same PoC holds: alice's second claim reverts, bob is paid in full.

## Watching the cursor suite fail (opt-in)

The epoch handler runs both vaults under the same invariants (64 runs × 12 calls). Gated so default CI stays green:

```bash
DEMO_RUN_KILLED=1 forge test --match-contract VulnerableEpochQueueInvariant -vv
```

| Invariant | Cursor-bound queue | Cursor-less queue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `withdrawals_cannot_exceed_deposits` | HOLDS | holds* |
| `vault_balance_matches_ledger` | HOLDS | holds* |
| `no_request_overpays` | HOLDS | **FAILS** |

\*Token-level conservation **cannot** catch this bug with one solvent vault: the balance floors at zero and the final over-claim simply reverts. The leak lives one level down, in per-request accounting — which is why the suite tracks it with per-request ghost variables. Reviews that only check "withdrawn ≤ deposited" sign off on this bug.

## Layout

```
src/ReceiptSplitVault.sol   # MockAsset + split vault + bound vault
src/EpochQueueVault.sol     # cursor-less queue + cursor-bound queue + shared interface
test/SplitLedgerPoC.t.sol   # directed PoC and edge cases
test/EpochQueuePoC.t.sol    # directed cursor-drain PoC (both variants)
test/EpochQueueUnit.t.sol   # maturity / ownership / partial-claim / keeper checks + fuzz
test/Invariant.t.sol        # handler + bound-vault invariants
test/EpochQueueInvariant.t.sol  # queue handler + invariants (killed variant gated)
```

`forge test` — 20 passed, 1 gated suite skipped.

## What a full engagement adds

- Fork tests against a pinned commit or live deployment (authorized scope only)
- Invariants on the actual money-moving identity: receipt id, epoch index, match id, withdrawal cursor, forwarder sender
- Upgrade-diff pass if production shipped recently
- Every finding delivered as a failing-then-fixed test. `forge test` is the report.
